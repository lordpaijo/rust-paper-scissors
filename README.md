# RUST, PAPER, SCISSORS!

This is my first rust-written project: a rock, paper, and scissors game. I have a lot of fun with it but don't expect me to get a job. It was built using cargo.

## Dependencies
 - cargo (duh)
 - rand
 - colored

## Installing

The package is available at [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rps_paijo). You can install it via [Cargo](https://crates.io/), or by building it yourself. (Make sure you have cargo installed already.)

### Cargo
```sh
$ cargo install rps_paijo

```

### Build from source
Clone the repo 👹.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lordpaijo/rust-paper-scissors.git # https
$ git clone git@github.com:lordpaijo/rust-paper-scissors.git     # ssh
$ cd rust-paper-scissors/
```

Now let's get rusty...
```
$ cargo update # updating the project dependencies...
$ cargo build # buzzzbuzzbuzzz, here comes the slow-ass build...
```

## Playing
Finished installing or building, you can now play the game. If you installed the already published package, then you can execute it by typing `rps_paijo` on your terminal just like any other CLI apps. Or if you built it from source, then do the followings:

```sh
$ cd rust-paper-scissors/
$ cargo run

```

## Thanks......
